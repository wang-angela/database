# In-Memory Database

This project implements an in-memory key-value database in Go with transaction support.

## Prerequisites

[Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

## How to Run

1. Verify Go is installed by opening a commonand prompt and typing the following command:

```bash
$ go version
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wang-angela/database.git
$ cd database
```

3. Initialize a Go module:

```bash
$ go mod init github.com/wang-angela
```

4. Compile and run:

```bash
$ go run main.go
```

## Assignment Modification

To make this assignment more of an "official assignment" in the future, the addition of a unit testing requirement would be highly beneficial. This would encourage students to thoroughly understand how their database should function and construct appropriate unit tests to handle all edge cases. Additionally, providing a pre-designed testing suite with multiple test cases would reduce the need to interpret results and offer a more objective grading process. These enhancements would streamline evaluation while improving the learning experience for students.
